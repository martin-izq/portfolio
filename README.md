Personal professional portfolio and resume website.

This repository contains a lightweight, framework-agnostic personal website designed to showcase professional experience, technical skills, and career background in a clear, accessible, and scalable way.

## Goals

- Present professional experience in a clear and readable format
- Ensure compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Demonstrate clean front-end architecture and design consistency
- Keep the codebase simple, fast, and easy to maintain
